    "title":"Hi!",
    "body":"My name is Maxence Palkowski, curious and passionate about technology.\nFreshly Graduated from JUNIA ISEN - Lille, I am open for IT position opportunities in Japan.\n\nDisciplined and independent, my work experience has trained me in team communication, the creation of clear documentation and problem solving. My responsibilities have also led me to software architecture design and application development following SOLID principles.\n\nInternational travels I've engaged in have broadened my perspective on the world and its inhabitants. Through the Rotary Club's Youth Exchange Program, I lived for a year in Neepawa, Manitoba, Canada, in 2018. I emerged from this experience with native-level English proficiency and a desire to explore the cultures of other countries.\n\nI have a background of art work with my singing and piano lessons I took for most of my childhood. This helps me to have a fresh and artistic point of view on more grounded subjects. The same goes for my interest in Musical Theatre and Cinema."
